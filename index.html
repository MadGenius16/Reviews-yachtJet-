                            I love this chocolate bar. Perfect combination of light crispy wafer, covered in a thin layer chocolate.

                            This chocolate confection is a delight! A delight! The wafer is light and crisp, the hazelnut cream is
                            smooth, and the
                            chocolate is good.

                            Chocolate is a family favourite treat. Love the delicious smooth chocolate and the creaminess inside. The
                            wafer is soft
                            but crunchy.

                    I rented the Lagoon 620 with my family for a week-long vacation and it was the best decision ever. The yacht
